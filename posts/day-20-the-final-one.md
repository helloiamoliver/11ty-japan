For our last day in Japan, we headed out to explore Hakone. A popular spot for Japanese tourists, the area is known for its hot springs and views of Mount Fuji!

We hopped onto the Cable Car (more my idea of a funicular, but fun nonetheless!) and headed up into the mountains, hoping to catch a glimpse of Fuji!

After the cable car, you change onto a ropeway (confusingly, what I would call a cable car) and swing out over the hills. 

We trundled along for a while, before spotting Mount Fuji, just poking out over the cloud in the distance!

It was lovely to be able to see Mount Fuji once more, although we'd been very lucky throughout the trip with our Fuji-spotting!

Randomly, we decided to hop on a pirate ship once we reached the end of the ropeway. It chugged gently across the lake, and had a good amount of breeze!

We then took a bus all the way back up the mountains to the Hakone Open Air Museum, an outdoor art museum filled with sculptures and installations from many famous artists. It was very pleasant to spend a couple of hours pootling around the gardens, and it was also great fun to see all of the Picasso pieces that they owned!

Overall, a really fab final day, wrapping up a fab trip!
