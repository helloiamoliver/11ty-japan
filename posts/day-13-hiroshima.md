Today really ha swung between two extremes! We boarded our first Shinkansen, the Kayagaki #501, bound for Tsuruga. This was amazing!!!!!

We then changed onto Thunderbird #14, which was also FAB. Our final train was another Shinkansen, the Nozomi #19, which I was outraged to find was ten whole minutes delayed! Absolutely shocking! Though the delay was due to earthquakes, so...

Once we arrived in Hiroshima, we headed over to our swanky hotel near the station, stamping our Eki stamps along the way! After a Konbini lunch, we headed out to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

We visited the Peace Memorial Museum, which held harrowing accounts of the day the bomb was dropped in 1945. It was a difficult couple of hours, but a very important place to visit. 

We then walked through the Peace Park, and saw the ruins of the Atomic Bomb Dome. The dome has been preserved in it's state when the bomb dropped, and serves as a poignant reminder of the destruction the bomb caused.

After this, we hopped onto the tram, and went back to the hotel for the evening, via a Ippudo ramen!
