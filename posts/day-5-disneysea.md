Today was Disney-day! After much consideration, we decided to head out to the park at around 10am, giving us late morning and the afternoon to explore Tokyo DisneySea.

It was incredible!! I think my favourite has to be 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which was a beautiful delve underneath the surface of the ocean. It was enormous fun! I also really enjoyed Journey to the Centre of the Earth, which was our first ride. It was immaculately themed, and the twists and turns were pretty stomach churning, but still enjoyable!

We managed to get onto Indiana Jones in under a minute, as we used the barely-used single rider line, which jumped us straight to the front of the queue! It was well worth it!

We finished the day with the Believe! Sea of Dreams show in the Mediterranean Harbour. This was the huge evening spectacular, and we even paid extra to get seats at the front. However, we didn't realise the 'seated' area meant sat cross legged at the front! It was still enjoyable, and we headed home afterwards.
