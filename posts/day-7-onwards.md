We left Tokyo today, departing Shinjuku on the Azusa #13, bound for Matsumoto. After a peaceful, albeit occasionally jerky, train ride through the outskirts of Tokyo, we arrived at Matsumoto a couple of hours later.

We headed up to the Matsumoto Castle, and after a quick Konbini lunch, we headed into the main keep of the castle. Seven storeys high, the castle dates from 1504, and is one of Japan's most popular castles.

We explored around here for an hour, before going back to the station and boarding our Shinano #18 towards Nagiso.

We're now staying in a beautiful Ryokan in _____, the _______. The views are absolutely stunning, and we had a delicious evening meal. There are six rooms in the entire guesthouse, and it feels very quiet (the soothing rain outside also helps!).
