We're now at the penultimate stop of our little trip around Japan - Kyoto! We left Hiroshima this morning on our penultimate train, the 10:03 NOZOMI #90 bound for Tokyo.

After a quick canter through Fukayama and Osaka, we arrived at Kyoto's manic central station. Compared to every other station we've visited, which have been gleaming, modern, and efficient, this was quite a contrast - no doubt it will be rebuilt imminently!

After checking into the hotel, we picked up a Konbini lunch and headed over to the Kyoto Gyoen National Gardens, which were deceivingly massive! We had a little potter around, before heading back for a couple of hours rest.

In the evening, we hopped on a bus up towards the Gion district. In Kyoto, Gion is the most well known Geisha district. It was lovely to walk around and soak up the atmosphere, although it was markedly busier than Kanazawa!

We ate at _curry & tempura koisus_, which as the Google reviews will attest, was absolutely incredible - I had both curry and tempura, which tasted excellent and were beautifully presented!

_For fans of Cabin Pressure, the Auspicious Pig and Whistle seems to be located in Kyoto..._

> The capital in the west,
