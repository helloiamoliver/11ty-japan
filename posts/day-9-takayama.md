Today we explored Takayama, a city high up in the mountains of Gifu. We headed out, and wandered about the old-town near our hotel.

We then decided to visit the Takayama Jinya, a historic governmental building just over the river. It was fascinating, and gave an insight into the history of the Edo period.

The beautiful gardens surrounded the complex, and it was lovely to stroll through the buildings and explore.

We then wandered back down the main street. Takayama is a very popular tourist destination, so has a wide range of exciting shops to investigate! Souvenirs were purchased!

Next, we headed over to the Takayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan, or Festival Float Exhibition Hall. Every spring and autumn, the streets of Takayama play host to a parade of traditional floats as part of the Takayama Festival.

In total, there are 11 floats, with the museum displaying three of them at a time (the others are held in storehouses sandwiched between houses around the town).

After this, we visited the Sakurayama Hachimangu Shrine, which was just next to the exhibition hall. This was stunning.

I really liked Takayama (particularly the shopping element), although it didn't feel quite real - the old town was very carefully maintained to help keep its historic feel, and this did lead it to feel a little like something out of a cartoon! It was beautiful though!
