We left the hotel just before 8am. It was raining up in the mountains, but as we drove towards Tokyo, it began to dry up!

The airport was quick and efficient, and we were through security and passport control swiftly! At this point, I began roaming around the terminal, trying to use up all the balance on my IC Cards. In the end, I bought some of these adorable burger biscuits!

We then boarded our B787-9 (G-ZBKK) bound for London.

After a long 14 hours, we approached Heathrow by flying over central London, with incredible views of the city at night!

And then, home.
