We rose early today, and after a quick breakfast, boarded a train (and ferry!) over to Miyajima Island. It was already pretty busy and hot by the time we got there at around 9am, but it was still good to explore!

We were mobbed by the (terrifyingly aggressive) deer within about 10 minutes, but they soon decided we weren't interesting when we refused to feed them!

We then pottered on round, taking photos of the gate from various different angles.

The island also has an aquarium, which we visited - I was particularly pleased with my photo of the jellyfish (although I did have thoughts on the animal welfare otherwise...).

By this time, it was sweltering, so we headed back to the hotel for some downtime. The hotel is right next to the station, so I went for a swim in the pool with a fab view of the Shinkansen on the tracks below!

In the evening, we ventured back outside, boarding a bus to the AEON Mall Hiroshima. After filling a basket in MUJI, we also got to experience the 100Â¥, which was also great!

All in all, another great day!
