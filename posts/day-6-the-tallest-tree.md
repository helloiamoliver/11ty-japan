DisneySea was always going to be a hard act to follow, but today's been pretty good. We started the day at the Tokyo National Museum, where we saw a variety of objects and paintings important to the history of the country.

This was interesting, and their were a few paintings I thought were beautiful. We then stopped, and had a leisurely lunch in their small restaurant. This too was good.

After this, we headed over to the Senso-ji temple, and explored their. It was absolutely rammed with tourists, but you occasionally came across a quiet nook, which was a little magical.

We then walked over towards the Tokyo SkyTree, before hopping in the lift and blasting up to the top. 

It was pretty magical looking down on Tokyo from 350m above, and we were lucky enough to be able to see the sun set across the city.

After descending once more, we ate in the food hall underneath - I had an excellent Chicken Oyakodon, which really hit the spot!

Overall, a pretty good day!
