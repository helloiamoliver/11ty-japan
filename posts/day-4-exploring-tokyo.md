We began the day by visiting the Kando Myojin shrine. This was in the heart of Chiyoda, and it was lovely to visit.

After this, we went to Akhibara, the electric city! Here, we visited a few different shops, including a PC components store and a retro games emporium! It was all pretty crazy, but really fun to explore.

After a rest over lunch, we went to the Meiji-jingu shrine. This was nestled in the middle of beautiful woodland, and the light was truly stunning.Â

From here, we visited the famous Shibuya crossing, and watched from the station as people scrambled across the concrete like hundreds of ants. I was also excited to see the statue to Haku-san, in honour of the dog who continued to go to the station to wait after his owner's death.

In the evening, we went on a great food tour around Ebisu. This was really good fun, and we sampled a range of different foods. I really enjoyed the apple and apricot sorbets that we had at the end, but it was all great!
