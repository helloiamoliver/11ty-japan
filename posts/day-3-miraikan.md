After our induction from Satoe, we headed over to The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, or Miraikan.

For me, the highlight has to be the robot dog!!

The satellite imagery of the earth over the last 24 hours was also cool!

On the way back to the hotel, we got caught in absolutely torrential rain. Despite being drenched to the skin, the sea of umbrellas was magical.

I also managed to get my first two Eki Stamps! One from Tōkyō station, and the other from Shinjuku!
